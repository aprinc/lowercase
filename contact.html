            FAQ's:
            How did you come up with your website?
            <br>
            <br>
            Honestly, I looked online and found a website "theme/look" that I liked and decided I would try and replicate that.
            <br>
            <br>
            What is your website about?
            <br>
            <br>
            Nothing I just wanted it to look good, but this kinda made trying my content for each page hard since my webite is about nothing.
            <br>
            <br>
            Clearly that phone number is'nt your number. So who's is it?
            <br>
            <br>

            What is the purpose behind your wbesite's name?
            <br>
            <br>
            There is no true meaning behind it, I just chose it just because. As I have said be before there is no true meaning for anything on my website.
