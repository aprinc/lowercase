<h1> Website Development</h1>
<br>
<p> When I startedmy a website, my first priority was working on the technical side and making sure to make my webiste feasible since I would be the one working on it. By planning what I will and want to accomplish. Yes, it seems obvious, but this is an important part of creating a sucessful website.</p>
