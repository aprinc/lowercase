            <p> Our core mission is to make this website look very legitimate and very professional as possible. We plan on doing this by using lots of big words like devoted, objective, and committed. This website truly has no real purpose at all. But the bright side of this website is I did all the coding myself and it's great to look at. Or if your just here to click on the different buttons, that works too. Honestly I am just as lost as you are, most of the time while creating this website I was super confused. Basically all I did was started by asking for help and eventually figured it out.
